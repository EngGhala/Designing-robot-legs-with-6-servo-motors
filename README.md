Here’s your step-by-step guide to designing robot legs with 6 servo motors:
1. Start a New Design: Go to the Tinkercad website and start a new project by clicking on “Create new design.”
2. Create the Foot: Begin with a “Box” or “Cylinder” shape to create the foot. Adjust its size and shape to ensure it provides a stable base for your robot.
3. Build the Leg Segments: Add “Box” shapes above the foot to form the leg segments. Arrange and resize these shapes to create a functional and proportionate leg structure.
4. Duplicate the Leg: Once you’ve finished the design of the first leg, duplicate it to create the second leg. This ensures both legs are identical and balanced.
5. Add the Base: Position a “Box” or “Cylinder” shape above the duplicated legs to serve as the base. This component should connect the two legs and provide stability for your robot.
6. Attach Servo Motors:
    * Servo Placement: Add 6 servo motors to your design, plcing them as:
        * 2 servos at the hip joints (one for each leg)
        * 2 servos at the knee joints (one for each leg)
        * 2 servos at the ankle joints (one for each leg)
    * Installation: Drag and place the servo motors in the appropriate locations.
7. Align & Save Design: Ensure that the legs and servo motors are properly aligned with the base. Once everything is set, save your design to preserve your progress.
